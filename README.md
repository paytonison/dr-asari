# Dr. Asari, MD*, Cognitive Behavioral Therapist

*not really a medical doctor (yet)

## Why do I care?
Following the covid-19 pandemic, it became apparent that humanity, especially Western nations, are at a crossroads with their understanding of mental health. Unfortunately, most mental health professionals offering psychotherapy are prohibitively expensive for low-income patients, Medicaid/Medicare may not assure a high quality provider, and a doctor is not available 24/7 for when something comes up that can't wait, but doesn't necessitate an emergency situation.

The most effective method of psychotherapy is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT [not *THAT* CBT]). In essence, it works by reprogramming your brain's responses to triggering stressors and enviornments/circumstances. It's relatively straightforward to do, but most resources for CBT are paywalled, either through insurance or self-help books (ironically enough, self-help books like Chicken Soup for the "Y" are CBT-based).

A few problems arise from the lack of access to CBT treatment: It's not well-known, it's not easily accessible, and it requires self-awareness and self-awareness, for most people, is only achieved when someone holds the mirror for them. As such, a highly effective method that works considerably well from treating depression to PTSD to insomnia is thereby unavailable to those who need it most [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3584580/]. When people think of a psychotherapist, they think of a leather sofa in a musty study, surrounded by books, as Sigmund Freud asks them about penis envy and their relationship with their mother. That don't work no more (let alone at all). Dr. Asari's goal, therefore, is to act as the mirror for the patient while also holding it and asking them questions about what they see and what they want to change while making suggestions.

Using the o3-mini model would be revolutionary as it's a small, compact, cheap model to run, while still maintaining the power of the o1 series at a considerably lower cost; the ability to reason at various degrees of complexity furthers the use of o3-mini as the backbone, along with the potential to make a dynamic reasoning function (Hmmm...); and using conversation history between the patient and Dr. Asari provides a running dialogue for the model to evaluate, check patient symptoms, if they're better or worse--if the latter, suggesting immediate medical intervention--and allow the patient to print the conversations to submit to a human doctor for further evaluation if necessary.

Of course, the endgame would be getting approved by the APA and FDA to practice therapy at a national level, but small-scale beta tests in select locations where licensing restrictions are lower would do just as well as the model is further tweaked and evaluated (I know a certain someone who'd benefit from this).

Overall, I think by balancing the model type, finding the correct reasoning complexity, integrating such a thing through the API or developing it for Apple to use in their Health app, powered by ChatGPT-Apple Intelligence, this could prove revolutionary in the field of mental health and usher forth much-needed relief for the struggles of many since 2020 laid bare humanity's collective trauma.

And who doesn't love the prospect of a Nobel, huh?
