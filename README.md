# Panacea (a tad on-the-nose)

## Why do I care?
After the covid-19 pandemic, humanity, especially Western nations, is at a crossroads with mental health. Unfortunately, mental health professionals offering psychotherapy are prohibitively expensive, Medicaid/Medicare may not assure a high quality provider, and a doctor is rarely available 24/7 for something unpleasant, but not dangerous, e.g., intrusive thoughts, panic attacks, PTSD flashbacks, a shoulder to cry on.

Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT [not *THAT* CBT]) is the most effective method of psychotherapy by reprogramming your thought patterns. It's relatively straightforward, but most resources for CBT are paywalled, putting a powerful method against depression, anxiety, PTSD, OCD, traumatic experiences, and even insomnia, out of reach.

I'm using xxxxxxxx because it's small, compact, quick, and cheap to deploy, yet produces high quality responses. Conversation history between the patient and Panacea provide a running dialogue for the model to evaluate progress, analyze patient symptoms, and serve as a reference for doctors.

**If the user is in crisis, it emphantically demands they seek medical attention immediately.**

The endgame is approval by the APA and FDA for national deployment, but small-scale beta tests in select locations, where licensing requirements are lax, would be just fine.

Overall, Panacea can change the mental health game by democritizing a crucial, yet often ignored, piece of health care. The butterfly effect from such an achievement is monumental and historic. Besides, who doesn't want a Nobel?
