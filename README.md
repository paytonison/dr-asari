# Panacea (a tad on-the-nose)

## Why do I care?
After the covid-19 pandemic, humanity, especially Western nations, is at a crossroads with mental health. Unfortunately, mental health professionals offering psychotherapy are prohibitively expensive, Medicaid/Medicare may not assure a high quality provider, and a doctor is rarely available 24/7 for something unpleasant, but not dangerous, e.g., intrusive thoughts, panic attacks, PTSD flashbacks, a shoulder to cry on.

Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT [not *THAT* CBT]) is the most effective method of psychotherapy by reprogramming your thought patterns. It's relatively straightforward, but most resources for CBT are paywalled, putting a powerful method against depression, anxiety, PTSD, OCD, traumatic experiences, and even insomnia, out of reach.

I'm using gpt-4.1-mini because it's small, compact, quick, and cheap to deploy, yet produces high quality responses. Conversation history between the patient and Panacea provide a running dialogue for the model to evaluate progress, analyze patient symptoms, and serve as a reference for doctors.

**If the user is in crisis, it emphantically demands they seek medical attention immediately.**

The endgame is approval by the APA and FDA for national deployment, but small-scale beta tests in select locations, where licensing requirements are lax, would be just fine.

Overall, Panacea can change the mental health game by democritizing a crucial, yet often ignored, piece of health care. The butterfly effect from such an achievement is monumental and historic. Besides, who doesn't want a Nobel?

## CHANGE LOG
* switched from o3-mini to newly-released GPT-4.1-mini for cheaper inference and similar lexiolgical performance, but faster generation speed
* formatted prompt to make it not a schizo-rat's nest
* edited README to make it accurate and not terrible
* specified AI's voice to make it less clinical and more friendly
* still haven't found Trent
